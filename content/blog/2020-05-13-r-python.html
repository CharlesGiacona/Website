<p>Here is a picture of me just before I went on one of the longest “hikes” of my life.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-05-13-r-python_files/blogpic.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am standing at the top of the Grand Canyon. If you have not been, I DEFINETELY recommend the trip; it was one of the most magnificent things I have ever seen. My visit at the Grand Canyon was part of a southwest road trip my childhood friend and I decided to take. We mainly stuck to national parks and other outdoor activities.</p>
<p>When I heard about a ~9-hour hike down the canyon I saw an exciting challenge. However, as a fitness nerd, who was trying to put on weight, I did not want to go at a caloric deficit for the day. I decided to calculate about how many calories I would burn during the hike so that I know how much more food I need to eat to maintain a caloric surplus for the day (aka putting on weight).</p>
<p>If I knew about R and python at the time it would have went a little something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code for calculating calories burned

library(reticulate)

#Time spent hiking in the Grand Canyon
time_spent&lt;- 8.75</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>#Taking over these calculations in python

#estimated calories burned/ hour hiking
c_per_hr = 710

#calculation of calories burned during the hike
c_hiking=c_per_hr*r.time_spent
print(c_hiking)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 6212.5</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>#Double checking in R code

#calories burned during the hike using raw numbers
c_hiking&lt;- 710*8.75

#do they match up?
py$c_hiking == c_hiking</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>6,212.5 is a number that was difficult to swallow.</p>
<p>Here is how I did it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#using R to create a data frame of my meals and their calories
df &lt;- data.frame(&quot;meal&quot; = c(&quot;breakfast&quot;,&quot;snack1&quot;,&quot;lunch&quot;,&quot;snack2&quot;,&quot;dinner&quot;,&quot;snack3&quot;), &quot;calories&quot; = c(1725, 500, 1875, 450, 2000, 550))
df</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        meal calories
## 1 breakfast     1725
## 2    snack1      500
## 3     lunch     1875
## 4    snack2      450
## 5    dinner     2000
## 6    snack3      550</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------ tidyverse 1.3.0 --</code></pre>
<pre><code>## v ggplot2 3.3.0     v purrr   0.3.4
## v tibble  3.0.1     v dplyr   0.8.5
## v tidyr   1.0.3     v stringr 1.4.0
## v readr   1.3.1     v forcats 0.5.0</code></pre>
<pre><code>## -- Conflicts --------------------------------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>#how much I ended up eating that day
colSums(Filter(is.numeric, df))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## calories 
##     7100</code></pre>
<p>For fun I will use python to find the largest meal of the day.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Switching to python: Using pandas and seaborn to emulate the tidyverse

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 

#using data frame created in R code
df=r.df

#selecting and filtering to see the 2000 calorie meal
(df.filter([&#39;meal&#39;, &#39;calories&#39;]).query(&#39;calories == &quot;2000&quot;&#39;).head(3))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      meal  calories
## 4  dinner    2000.0</code></pre>
