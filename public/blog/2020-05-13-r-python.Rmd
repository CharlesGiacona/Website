Here is a picture of me just before I went on one of the longest "hikes" of my life.

![](/blog/2020-05-13-r-python_files/blogpic.jpg)

  I am standing at the top of the Grand Canyon. If you have not been, I DEFINETELY recommend the trip; it was one of the most magnificent things I have ever seen. My visit at the Grand Canyon was part of a southwest road trip my childhood friend and I decided to take. We mainly stuck to national parks and other outdoor activities. 
  
  When I heard about a ~9-hour hike down the canyon I saw an exciting challenge. However, as a fitness nerd, who was trying to put on weight, I did not want to go at a caloric deficit for the day. I decided to calculate about how many calories I would burn during the hike so that I know how much more food I need to eat to maintain a caloric surplus for the day (aka putting on weight).
  
  If I knew about R and python at the time it would have went a little something like this:

```{R}
#R code for calculating calories burned

library(reticulate)

#Time spent hiking in the Grand Canyon
time_spent<- 8.75
```



```{python}
#Taking over these calculations in python

#estimated calories burned/ hour hiking
c_per_hr = 710

#calculation of calories burned during the hike
c_hiking=c_per_hr*r.time_spent
print(c_hiking)
```

```{R}
#Double checking in R code

#calories burned during the hike using raw numbers
c_hiking<- 710*8.75

#do they match up?
py$c_hiking == c_hiking
```

6,212.5 is a number that was difficult to swallow. 


Here is how I did it:

```{R}
#using R to create a data frame of my meals and their calories
df <- data.frame("meal" = c("breakfast","snack1","lunch","snack2","dinner","snack3"), "calories" = c(1725, 500, 1875, 450, 2000, 550))
df
library(tidyverse)
#how much I ended up eating that day
colSums(Filter(is.numeric, df))
```

For fun I will use python to find the largest meal of the day.

```{python}
#Switching to python: Using pandas and seaborn to emulate the tidyverse

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 

#using data frame created in R code
df=r.df

#selecting and filtering to see the 2000 calorie meal
(df.filter(['meal', 'calories']).query('calories == "2000"').head(3))

```
