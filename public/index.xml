      <description>Here is a picture of me just before I went on one of the longest “hikes” of my life.
I am standing at the top of the Grand Canyon. If you have not been, I DEFINETELY recommend the trip; it was one of the most magnificent things I have ever seen. My visit at the Grand Canyon was part of a southwest road trip my childhood friend and I decided to take.</description>

      <description>Introduction:I decided to analyze the dataset ‘Salaries’ from the package ‘carData’ for project 2. ‘Salaries’ contains 397 observations with 6 variables: ‘rank’ (AssocProf, AsstProf, and Prof), ‘discipline’ (A: “theoretical” departments/B: “applied” departments), ‘yrs.since.phd’, ‘yrs.service’, ‘sex’ (Female or Male), and ‘salary’ (nine-month salary US$). The data was initially collected to survey for pay inequalities among male and female faculty at an unnamed university.

      <description>Introduction:I have chosen four datasets describing demographic characteristics of 215 countries in the world. My first and second data sets contain adolescent fertility rate, measured by the number of births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 19, and infant mortality rate, measured by the number of deaths per 1,000 live births of children under one year of age, for the year 2017. Lastly, my third and fourth data sets contain data on domestic general government health expenditure per capita and overall GDP per capita (current US$) for the year 2017.</description>
